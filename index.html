            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2000 in Switzerland, <span class="highlight">Marvera Group</span> was born out of a vision to create a company that seamlessly bridges global markets with precision, integrity, and innovation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our name, a fusion of <em>“Mar”</em> (sea) and <em>“Vera”</em> (truth), reflects our commitment to honesty, transparency, and international reach — values that remain at the core of everything we do.

            <h2>Relationship with Hafen Consolidators</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Hafen Consolidators</span> is our operational front, specialising in freight forwarding, NVOCC services, and international trading. While Hafen manages the complex logistics, client relations, and commercial execution, Marvera Group operates strategically behind the scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ensure that the business is aligned with European-style precision, long-term planning, and disciplined operational standards. Think of it as Hafen being the engine, while Marvera is the navigation system: guiding, supporting, and safeguarding the company’s growth and reputation.
